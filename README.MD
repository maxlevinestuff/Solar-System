Most things are "somewhat" to-scale! Orbit distance and radius of all the planets were scaled down exponentially: for radius, I took the cube root, and for orbit distance, I took the 3.5 root. A to-scale atmosphere layer is represented on the terrestrial planets; it's hard to see (atmosphere is very small compared to planet radius), but the effect is easiest to see on earth. The period and relative orbit speeds are sped up but to-scale. If the planet has one or more moons, then the planet has one moon circling it; the size and orbit of the moons are not to-scale. The degree of orbital inclination (variance from the orbital plane) for each planet is also included (but the planets in our solar system stick closely to the orbital plane).
